# Daniel's Github Homepage!

 ![alt text](images/banners/1.webp)

 Welcome to my homepage on Github!

 I use Github (mostly) as a notepad to jot down and share markdown documentation, but there's the odd useful Python program and Bash script here too. 

 Current interests: exploring large language models (LLMs); thinking broadly about ways to organise and store LLM outputs; working on a project to create a graph-native system for storing AI-derived text snippets.

 Older and less exciting interests: Linux backup (these days, I use OpenSUSE), data visualisation, and (though less on Github) leveraging all that to tell the stories behind the numbers.
