**Hi and welcome to my little space on Github!**

## GPT Work, Research

Where I'm currently bringing my focus:

- [GPTs](https://github.com/danielrosehill/My-Github-Repo-Index/blob/main/sections/gpts.md) -  Like apparently everyone alive, I'm currently enraptured by the potential of GPTs to reshape our world and am interested in exploring some of the truly transformative use-cases. I'm particularly interested in using GPTs for professional/business applications including automating research and data analysis. In support of those objectives, I'm learning prompt engineering, Python scripting, and finding imaginative ways to leverage the already astounding capabilities of LLMs. I'm particularly engaged by the idea of "*GPT Fleets*" - or the potential and synergies that can be best realised through utilising multiple custom GPTs (GPT agents) in harmony. 

### Specific Project

- I've been on an open-ended quest for the past few months to develop a scalable and powerful knowledge management system for managing GPT **output** at scale by capturing prompt outputs, custom GPT configuration parameters, and prompts and relating the datasets in the most logical way possible. It's a work in progress. But if I cook up something good and replicable, I plan on open-sourcing the outcome.

## Contact 

I dislike low-effort crawling spam as much as the next guy, gal, or sloth. But if you have a real reason to be in touch, shoot me an email, preferably authored by a human!
