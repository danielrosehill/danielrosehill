## 👋 Welcome!

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a tech communications professional with a deep interest in AI workflows & LLMs, working to drive positive change through technology.

## 🚀 Current Focus

I'm currently working in the nonprofit sector (impact investing), where I combine creative and technical approaches to data visualization to better communicate our industry's mission.

## 💡 Key Interests

### Personal Context Repositories
I'm developing workflows for generating, storing, and utilizing personal context repositories. My belief is that RAG approaches, even at modest scales, can provide significant value for personal applications.

### LLM Output Management
I'm exploring output management through open-source projects, creating CRUD prototypes for:
- Storing and managing LLM outputs systematically
- Relating outputs to prompt libraries
- Integrating agent configurations in data stores
- Initial implementation: PostgreSQL
- Exploring: MongoDB and Neo4J architectures

## 🎯 Vision

While AI technologies like DALL-E offer entertaining possibilities, my primary focus is on leveraging AI to improve lives meaningfully. I maintain a diverse collection of LLM assistants, yet I believe we're only beginning to scratch the surface of potential applications.
